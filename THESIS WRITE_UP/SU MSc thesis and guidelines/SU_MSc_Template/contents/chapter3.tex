A simulation study was conducted which allows changing parameters of interest (i.e. the number of target statistics and number of simulations). All simulations and analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12)

\section{Obtaining Targtes}
As target statistics in this study, there were two scenarios. Scenario one (S1) considered two target features (prevalence at two-time points, 50 and 75) and scenario two (S2) looked at three target features (peak prevalence for each model run in addition to the two-time points in scenario one).

R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12) was used to perform the statistical analyses and datasets were obtained from a stochastic SIR model using the SIR function in the SimInf library \cite{siminf}. To obtain targets for scenario one, the SIR model was ran once with known parameter values $\beta = 0.2, \gamma = 0.02$ and the prevalence at times $50$ and $75$ were saved as target statistics. Similarly for scenario two, the SIR model was ran once with the same known parameter values and the prevalence at times $50$ and $75$, as well as the peak prevalence, were saved as targets (see Figure \ref{targs1,targs2} below).
