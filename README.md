This is my MSc project as SACEMA and we seek to compare model calibration methods to ascertain which of the methods performs best in terms of 
  - closeness to the "true posterior"
  - efficiency
#The methods to be compared are 
  * Rejection Approximate Bayesian Computation (RABC)
  * Sequential Approximate Bayesian Computation (SABC)
  * Bayesian Maximum Likelihood Estimation (BMLE)
