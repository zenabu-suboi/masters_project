Description: This ABCtargets package contains a function called targets. This function 
             runs a stochastic SIR model and outputs different results per model run.
            The peak prevalence of each model output and/or prevalence at time
            points 50 and 75 are saved in a matrix. The model is run 100 times saving the
            prevalence values. The mean prevalence values are computed as targets.
