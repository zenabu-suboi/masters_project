Make changes in README
Include flow Diagram in README
Revisit old code and remove any duplications
Figure out which part of code takes long
Parallelize code to run simulations faster:
  - isolate script to be run in parallel
  - accept command line input for number of simulations
  - have script save results to unique filename
  - write separate script to combine results
