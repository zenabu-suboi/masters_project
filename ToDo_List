Make changes in README
Include flow Diagram in README
Revisit old code and remove any duplications

##Goal for Friday:
Parallelize the 10e6 simulation code to run faster:
  - use doParallel package in R to parallelize code on my computer ? ==> minimal goal
OR
Try command line?
  - isolate script to be run in parallel
  - accept command line input for number of simulations**
  - have script save results to unique filename
  - write separate script to combine results
